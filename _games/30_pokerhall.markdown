PokerHall was a social multiplayer poker game for Facebook, developed at **Hive Digital Media**. 

From the beginning of the project, I was responsible for making all the frontend for the game, using **Flash** and **AS3**. Later on I also worked on the real-time server, written in **Java** with **SmartFox Server**.
