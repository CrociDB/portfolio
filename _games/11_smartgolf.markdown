SmartGolf3D is a stereoscopic 3D game for **LG's SmartTV** developed at **Hive Digital Media**. Very simple mechanics were used to make this game fun, such as *shoot direction*, *shoot force*, *wind direction* and *wind force*, and still run on the poor hardware of the TV.

I was the only developer resposible for that game. The project was developed using **Flash** and **AS2 (Flash Lite)**.
