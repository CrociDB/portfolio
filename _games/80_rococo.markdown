Rococo VR is a GearVR experience created with the **Black River Studios** team. It's an immersive experience that places the player into a sophisticated, mysterious and elegant era. It was inspired in Rococo art style from 18th century which has a unique and distinctive appearance with a lot of contrast, silhouettes and ornaments.

Even though I didn't work in the development of it directly, I helped fixing bugs and polishing for the release of the game. It's free and can be downloaded through the [Oculus Store](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1063671847025811/).
