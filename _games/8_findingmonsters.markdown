[Jake & Tess' Finding Monsters Adventure](http://findingmonstersadventure.com/) is a game for [**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.blackriverstudios.findingmonstersadventure&hl=pt), [**GearVR**](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1011054248914698/) and **Oculus Rift** where you have to take pictures of creatures. This game was created by the talented team of **Black River Studios**.

I worked initially on the basic core of game, making sure it would be modular and well organized. Later on, I worked on several gameplay features and mechanics. Also played role on code optimization and bug fixing.
