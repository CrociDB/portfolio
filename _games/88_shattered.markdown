> 35 years after a civil war, the last sovereign has finally been located. Your mission is simple: infiltrate the base, locate the target and eliminate them. The weapon of choice is a specially modified old war robot, capable of taking its own actions.

You can download **Conflict0: Shattered** on the [Oculus Store for GearVR](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1397570263626312/).

I worked on this game since the very first prototypes, then wrote some of the most important core features such as the shooting and ballistics system and the main scene flow system.
