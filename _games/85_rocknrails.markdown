The world of Rock ‘n’ Roll has been silenced, so it’s time to get loud! Take up guitars and basses, and blow up the Silence Beasts with a BAAANG! Ride on rails all over the city, shredding riffs solo or jamming with your friends, and reclaim our city back in the name of Rock! Rock & Rails is a VR rail shooter demo with multiplayer in mind. Rock & Rails Demo is a [GearVR action experience](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1205886966120120/). The final game is still in production. 

I created this game's first prototype and have been working on the gameplay since then. Still working on the final game.
