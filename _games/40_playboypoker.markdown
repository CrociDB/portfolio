Playboy Poker started out as a fork of the PokerHall project, but with many new social features, such as *achievements*, *challanges* and *collectibles*.

I was the only developer responsible for the project for a long time. Working on the frontend in **Flash** and **AS3**, web services in **PHP** and the real-time server in **SmartFox Server**, **Java**.
