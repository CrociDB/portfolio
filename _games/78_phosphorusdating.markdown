Phosphorus Dating is a game about Technology and Relationships. Set in 1996, a lot of people is amazed by Internet and want to try to find someone to date online. Phosphorus Dating website has a very smart algorithm to find a match for anybody based on their gender, sexual orientation, age and interests, but for some reason this algorithm is not working as expected.

It was created for 2016 edition of the [JS13K game competition](http://js13kgames.com/). The game got the **8th place** in the *Desktop category* of the competition, and the **20th place** in the *Community Awards category*.

I created it using only Javascript. There's a full postmortem on [my blog](http://crocidb.com/articles/postmortem-phosphorus-dating.html).
