GameHero was a game made for an Intel's marketing campaing. With this game, **Hive Digital Media** wanted to show the evolution of the games, creating a 4-episode game, each game representing an era. This was a huge success in Brazil and other countries of the Latin America, hundreds of *youtubers* in Brazil, including some famous, recorded playing GameHero: [Leon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0J1PVCaeoc), [Monark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp7b0rmmvAM), [Nils](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3pREAnDWq0) and [VenomExtreme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhEpnCxC_kE).

I mainly worked on the launcher and the platform to run the first three games (the fourth one was only available through download), interfacing them with the services. Both the launcher and the first two games were created in **Flash** and **AS3**, the third and the fourth were created in **Unity3D** and **C#**. I also worked implementing gameplay features in the first and the last game.
