Galaxy11: Invasion was a game for Samsung's global marketing campaing on the **WorldCup Brazil 2014**, developed in its first party **Black River Studios**. It was a hit along with other games made for this event.

I was responsible for creating the backend RESTful services in **Python** and **Flask**. I also implemented all the service interfaces in the client game in **Unity3D** and **C#** and some parts of the gameplay such as the parkour mechanic.
