[InkOwl](http://filipemp.github.io/InkOwl/) is an open source tattoo inspiration **Android** application I created with my friend [Filipe Marques](http://filipemp.github.io/). It's still not published, since there are a few features yet to implement.

The app is created with the Android SDK in **Java**, using the Tumblr API for the content.
