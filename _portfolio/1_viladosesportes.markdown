Vila dos Esportes was a complete social game that ran on **Facebook**, developed at **Hive Digital Media**. It was a game for marketing **P&G** products in Brazil. 

The frontend was created in **Flash** and **AS3** and the backend with **PHP**. I was responsible for creating one of the minigames in the game. But later in the development I also worked on the main structure and the backend.
